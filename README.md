Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:Zveaga/so_long.git
```
Move inside the directory:
```
cd so_long
```
Compile:
```
make
```
This will create an executable called `so_long`.

Run it:
```
./so_long maps/map.ber
```
To change the map, replace "maps/map.ber" with the path to another map, as long as it respects the rules.
