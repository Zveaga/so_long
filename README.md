cd so_long
```
Compile:
```
make
```
This will create an executable called `so_long`.

```
To change the map, replace "maps/map.ber" with the path to another map as long as it respects the rules.

## Map rules
Map can only contain the following 5 characters:
  - `0` for empty space
  - `1` for a wall
  - `C` for a collectable
  - `E` for the map exit
  - `P` for the playerâ€™s starting position
